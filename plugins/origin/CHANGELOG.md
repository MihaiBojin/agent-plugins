# origin

Newest release first. Each says what changed, and the choices behind it.

## 0.7.0

- `git-worktree remove` never deletes the head branch. A linked worktree can
  hold it while the main checkout is on some other branch, and a head branch
  the remote already has reaches the merged test finished, so nothing else
  stopped the deletion.
  ([#3](https://github.com/MihaiBojin/agent-plugins/issues/3))
- A head branch named by `git-worktree-plugin.headBranch` is read as a branch
  name whichever way it is written: `origin/main` and `refs/heads/main` both
  name `main`.
- `git-worktree remove` takes a worktree with a detached HEAD. It goes when
  some ref already reaches the commit it sits on. When none does, the removal
  is refused, and `--force` prints `git worktree add --detach <path> <sha>` as
  the undo.
- `merge` leaves the branch on the remote where it is. `--no-delete-branch` is
  gone along with the behaviour it turned off, and says so.
- `--dry-run` and the run it describes name the same head branch. The
  `ls-remote` that answers when `refs/remotes/<remote>/HEAD` is missing writes
  nothing, so a dry run makes it too.

### Choices

The branch on the remote is the forge's to delete. GitHub's "automatically
delete head branches" and GitLab's "delete source branch" already decide it per
repository, so a `git push --delete` from here duplicated that decision and
re-derived protections the server enforces anyway. Against a branch the server
protects it reported `could not delete <branch>; it may already be gone`, which
was never true.

A worktree holding the head branch is removed rather than refused. Keeping the
head branch in a worktree of its own, with the main checkout elsewhere, is an
ordinary way to work, so the checkout is ordinary to remove; only the branch is
not. MihaiBojin/shell-plugins refuses the whole operation, and the two tools
disagree on purpose.

`repo_head_branch` is not cached. It is read inside `$( )` everywhere, so an
assignment made there dies with the subshell, and resolving it once in
`repo_require` would make every command fail in a repository whose default
branch is unclear — including the commands that never ask. A caller needing
both the branch and the ref asks once and passes the branch to
`repo_head_ref_for`.

A missing `refs/remotes/<remote>/HEAD` costs an `ls-remote`, and that is rare
enough to accept. `git fetch` creates the ref, since
`remote.<name>.followRemoteHEAD` defaults to `create` on git 2.48 and later,
and `repo_fetch` runs first. What is left is an older git, an explicit
`followRemoteHEAD=never`, a remote advertising no HEAD, or a fetch that failed.
